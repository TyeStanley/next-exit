Next Exit is a social platform designed to find recipe and movie selections for users unable to choose themselves. We have a recipe selector and a movie selector that will pull up options. 

## User Story
AS A user I will be able to view a responsive site. AS an undecisive person I WANT to be given recipe and movie suggestions. WHEN I click on "Get Recipe" I WANT to be given a dinner recipe. WHEN I click on "Get Movie" I WANT to be given a movie suggestion.
